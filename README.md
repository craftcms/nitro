Nitro is a speedy local development environment thatâ€™s tuned for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/), powered by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Building from Source

If youâ€™d like to build Nitro directly from source to test a PR or unreleased feature, youâ€™ll need `go` and `make` in order to build a CLI binary for your OS.

If youâ€™re on macOS running [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and the [Apple developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) that come with Xcode, it should be quick and straightforward:

1. Run `brew install golang`.
2. Check out this repository and `cd /path/to/your/checkout`.
3. Run `make local`.

Nitroâ€™s dependencies will be downloaded automatically, and the built binary will be moved to `/usr/local/bin/nitro`.

Make sure thatâ€™s exactly what you see when you run `which nitro`:

```
$ which nitro
/usr/local/bin/nitro
```

If you installed Nitro with Homebrew, you might need to run `brew unlink nitro` so that the system uses the freshly-built binary instead. (To go back to using the Homebrew Nitro binary, use `brew link --overwrite nitro`.)

### Testing Docker Images

Nitro will pull Docker images that have been released. If you also need to test Docker changes, youâ€™ll want to build those as well:

1. Delete Nitroâ€™s site and proxy containers.
2. Check out https://github.com/craftcms/docker.
3. From the Docker project checkout, run `make setup` and `make build`. (Itâ€™ll take a while*.)
    > ðŸ’¡ You only need to run `make setup` once locally even if you run `make build` again later.
4. If youâ€™re testing the latest Nitro proxy image, `cd` to your Nitro project checkout and run `make docker` to build images from the local Dockerfile.
5. Run `export NITRO_DEVELOPMENT=true` in your terminal or add it to your shell profile so Nitro knows which images to pull.
6. In the same terminal session you used for the previous step, run `nitro apply`.

*: This will build everything for each architecture. If youâ€™d rather, you can build containers individually for amd64 by running `make local PHP_VERSION=X`, substituting `X` for the version of a single PHP image youâ€™d like to build.
